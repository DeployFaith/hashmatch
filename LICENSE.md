# License Overview

HashMatch is licensed under the Business Source License (BSL) 1.1.

This means:

- You are free to read, run, modify, and experiment with the code.
- You may use it for learning, research, and non-commercial projects.
- You may NOT use this project in production or offer it as a paid service
  without permission from the copyright holder.

## Commercial Use

Commercial use (including SaaS, hosted platforms, paid tools, or monetized
services) requires a separate commercial license.

If you are interested in commercial use, please contact the project owner.

## Future Open Source Conversion

Four (4) years after each version’s first public release, the code will
automatically convert to the Apache License 2.0.

At that point, it will become fully open source under Apache-2.0 terms.

## Why This License Exists

HashMatch is an early-stage platform project. This license protects the work
while the project matures, while still allowing learning, experimentation,
and community contribution.

If you want to build with HashMatch rather than around it, we’re happy to talk.
